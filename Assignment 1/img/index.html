                <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
                <p>Sleeping at the top, nightmares of the bottom
                    Everybody wanna be fly until you swat 'em
                    But who am I to talk? I ain't shittin' roses
                    We in the same picture but we all got different poses
                    Now I'm looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
                    I try to slow down, and I get rear-ended
                    Pause, like a red light, I'm dead right
                    Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
                    They say you don't know what you're doing 'til you stop doing it
                    Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
                    Attention all shooters: I'm a shooting star
                    Life is a course, and I'ma shoot for par<!--this has got to by my favourite line in this song because i enjoy golfing-->
                    Searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
                    And I put that shit right back, man, I'll see what I find tomorrow
                    Young Money, CMR, Blood like a scar
                    Weezy F. Baby and the "F" ain't for "Flaw"</p>
                    <h3>[Interlude]</h3> <!-- what even is a interlude lol-->
                    <p>Uh, uh
                        Yep, yep
                        Yep, yep</p>
            </section>

                <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
                <p>It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
                    Married to the money, a true love story
                    Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
                    Nothing standing in my way like nothing's my security
                    Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me,
                    <mark>If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney</mark> <!-- this lyric if funny to me because wayne had a marijuana charge that 3 years to get sentenced for -->
                    If you sleeping on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
                    I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
                    Now what we doin' with it?
                    Keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
                    I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin' with it
                    Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
                    Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
                    Yeah, the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
                    I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
                    And don't call me "Sir," call me "Survivor"</p>
                    <h3>[Interlude]</h3>
                    <p>Uh, uh
                        Yep, yep
                        Yep, yep</p>
            </section>

                <h3>[Verse 3]</h3>
                <p>Uh, call me "Killer" 'cause I make a killin'
                    I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
                    That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
                    And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
                    I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
                    These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
                    But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
                    I let them be, 'cause you know how the sting'll feel
                    Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
                    And I fuck up any track: train derail
                    Know how to roll, never need training wheels
                    And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
                    Uh, all or nothing or nothing else
                    I bleed reality, I should cut myself
                    Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
                    And the "F" is for "Fuck yourself"</p>

                <h3>[Outro]</h3>
                <p>Uhh, yeah
                And I ain't doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air
                And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
                So I'm feeling alright, I'm tryna stay aware
                And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there
                To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
                Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
                I'm trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear
                Weezy F. Baby and the "F" ain't for "Fear," uh</p>
